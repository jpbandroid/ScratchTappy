        "ScratchTappy circle disappears\n"
    "When the circle disappears from the Home section of the app, go into another section of the app and return to the section labelled Home and it will appear. If it doesn't appear, repeat the steps mentioned. If it does not appear after repeating the aformentioned steps, go to Settings -> Apps -> Apps/More apps/All apps (or nothing, depends on Android version and OEM) -> ScratchTappy (or search for ScratchTappy in the search bar, if available) -> Force Stop. If an alert appears, tap OK. After force-stopping the app, reopen the app from the launcher. The ScratchTappy circle will appear, ready for you to begin tapping. If this happens to the FAB (floating action button; in simple language a button) with the virus icon, do the aforementioned steps to get this button working\n\n"
        "App cannot be installed\n"
        "If the ScratchTappy app can't be installed, enable unknown sources in Settings.\n"
        "For Android 5.0-7.1.2 devices, go to Settings -> Privacy (or Advanced/Extra Features -> Privacy, depends on OEM skin and Android version), then tap Unknown Sources. If an alert appears, tap OK. After you have enabled Unknown Sources, go into your file manager of choice, find the ScratchTappy APK file (usually in Download folder as this is where browsers usually download files from the Internet onto your device) and tap on it. Tap Install to commence the installation.\n"
        "For Android 8.0+ devices, the installation process is a bit different. When the Package Installer window shows up, you get a prompt that your web browser cannot install the app for your device's security. Tap Settings on that prompt for it to redirect you a Settings page, where you have to tap Allow installs from unknown sources (or something similar, again it depends on OEM skins and Android version), On MIUI 12+, when an alert shows up showing what the web browser can do after enabling installation from unknown/untrusted sources. Check 'I assume all possible consequences voluntarily', wait until there is no 's' on OK and tap OK. *On all devices running Android 8.0+* You will now be redirected back to Package Installer. Tap Install to begin the installation.\n"
        "If you have Play Protect enabled, Play Protect will show you 2 prompts during the installation of the app. On the 1st prompt, tap 'Install Anyway', and on the second prompt tap 'Don't send app for scanning'.\n"
        "If you have an antivirus/device admin app, NOT Play Protect or MIUI Security, installed/enabled, it will block you from enabling unknown sources. Please uninstall the antivirus/device admin app and continue with the steps for your Android version. You can reinstall the antivirus app after the installation of ScratchTappy.\n"
        "If you have a user managed through Google Family Link, you CANNOT install the app due to Family Link installing itself as a system app and a device admin app and therefore, blocking Unknown Sources."
